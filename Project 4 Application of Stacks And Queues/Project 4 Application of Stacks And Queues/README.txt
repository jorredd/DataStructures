I NEED TO SET THE QUEUE TO BE A TEMPLATED CLASS SO I CAN USE IT TO HOLD THE LINES OF THE FILE AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE FILE

This will compare the beggining of the strings with the end of the strings because of the nature of the FILO FIFO.

I WILL NEED TO ENQUEUE THE QUEUE TO INSERT INTO THE STACK SO THAT THEY ARE OPPOSITES
