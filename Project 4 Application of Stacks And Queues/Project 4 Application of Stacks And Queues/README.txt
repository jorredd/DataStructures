I NEED TO SET THE QUEUE TO BE A TEMPLATED CLASS SO I CAN USE IT TO HOLD THE LINES OF THE FILE AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE FILE

AFTER THAT I CAN USE A STACK() TO COMPARE AGAINST THE QUEUE..

EXAMPLE: Stack.pop() == Queue.dequeue();

This will compare the beggining of the strings with the end of the strings because of the nature of the FILO FIFO
